# guessing_game

Simple Rust program for a guessing game. Given an input, provide high/low/equal feedback. Includes basic input validation.

Goals:

1. Generate a secret number to guess.
2. Accept typed input.
3. Make sure the input is the correct type. If not, ask for a new input.
4. Provide user feedback - higher, lower, or equal to secret number. If equal, stop running.

Based on Chapter 2 of the The Rust Programming Language (aka "The Book") except using fastrand instead of rand.
